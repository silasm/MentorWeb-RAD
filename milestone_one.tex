        working professionals.\\
        \\
        MentorWeb\index{MentorWeb} will create a mentor\index{Mentor}and
        mentee\index{Mentee} relationship by allowing users who choose to sign
        up as a mentee\index{Mentee} to follow mentors\index{Mentor}.\\
        \\
        MentorWeb\index{MentorWeb} will suggest certain mentors for each
        mentee\index{Mentee} by matching the mentee's\index{Mentee} aspirations
        to the mentor's\index{Mentor} background.\\
        \\
        Each mentee\index{Mentee} will be able to communicate to their
        mentors\index{Mentor} in a variety of ways without requiring additional
        tools.

    \subsection{Objectives and Success Criteria}

            % countries? In some countries encryption is illegal, but we
            % certainly want to encrypt e.g. user passwords.
            Software should not break any law or enable users to break any
            laws\\
            \\
            Privacy of user information marked private should be maintained\\
            \\
