Use a LaTeX compiler to compile a .tex file to a pdf (I recommend Texmaker for
beginners).

Use the makeindex program (should be bundled with LaTeX) to generate an index
file for use by LaTeX from the \index{key} tags in the document.

Some features, such as Table of Contents display, may require recompilation to
display correctly. I usually just recompile it a few times.
